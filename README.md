This project contains the solution to a challenge for the job vacancy under the position of devops engineer. The following is a description of its structure:

```

**Â¿How to run terraform?**

2. The following commands are expected to be used in a multi environment project
3. Replace environment_name with the name of the current environment

```
terraform init

terraform workspace list 

terraform workspace new environment_name //If the workspace does not exist

terraform workspace select environment_name

terraform plan -var-file="variables/environment_name.tfvars"

terraform apply --auto-aprove -var-file="variables/environment_name.tfvars"
